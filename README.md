# The Vault
Inspired by Obsidian, you can have vaults. 
A vault is, simply, a selected Folder in which all of the other files and folders reside

# The Links
When you enter a vault with Noto, you can link with `[[ Page Title ]]`
Each page can optionally display back links to everywhere where they have been linked from


# The databases
In the same way as Notion, you can add databases to your vault. 
Each database can hold rows of data. Each row may or may not be a page on its own right.
Under the hood, a database is simply a representation of a folder with 





-> Base folder/
    |-> .dbs/
    |   |-> db1
    |   |   |-> Row1 (page1.md)
    |   |   |-> Row2 (page2.md)
    |   |-> db2
    |       |-> Row1 (page1.md)
    |       |-> Row2 (page2.md)
    |-> Folder 1/
    |   |-> page 1.md 
    |   |-> page 2.md 
    |   |-> page 3.md 
    |-> Folder 2/
    |   |-> page 1.md 
    |   |-> page 2.md 
    |   |-> page 3.md
